The solution involves using the `!important` flag to override the inherited style:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green !important; /* Force override */
}
```

Alternatively, increase specificity of the `div p` selector to overcome the specificity of the `p` selector.  For example:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div > p {
  color: green; /* More specific selector */
}
```

The `>` ensures that only the direct child `p` elements of `div` are styled, preventing inheritance conflicts.  Choosing the right solution depends on your specific needs and coding style.  Using `!important` should be a last resort.
